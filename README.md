The problem addressed:
                  Global food shortage and food insecurity is a huge problem everywhere in the world. Aggrevated by political conflicts and the involvement of giant                       corporations, many people do not have access to a quality balanced diet. In addition, farmers, according to multiple studies, are hurt in many ways by                   profit-seeking corporations and middlemen. We wanted to address this issue in an attempt to create a community that slows and shares produce with each                   other. It is important to support farmers especially as the world is moving more tech-focused.
